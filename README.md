#  Policy Navigator Agent

##  Overview

The **Policy Navigator Agent** is an AI-powered agent designed to search, extract, and summarize complex policy and regulation documents â€” such as the GDPR, U.S. privacy laws, and other federal guidelines. It can respond to custom user queries, retrieve policy documents, and provide summarized outputs or citations based on indexed data.

##  Tool Integration Steps

1. **Index Dataset Content:**
   - Load `GDPR Violations` or any user-uploaded file.
   - Parse and embed into a searchable index using `IndexFactory`.

2. **Federal Register API:**
   - Pull regulation titles, links, and summaries using topic + date filters.

3. **Summarization Tool:**
   - Apply a lightweight LLM (`text-summarization-microsoft`) to compress long policies into readable summaries.

4. **SQL Tool:**
   - Extract query  (`create_sql_tool`)

##  Example Inputs & Outputs

**Input:**  
`Under the GDPR, when does the regulation apply to the processing of personal data? Then summarize it.`

**Tool Steps Used:**  
- `search-aixplain-general_data_protection_regulation_(eu)`  
- `text-summarization-microsoft`
